## Overview

The project is organized into different components:

- `Square`: Represents a square on the chessboard.
- `Board`: Manages the chessboard with a 2D array of "Square"
- `Player`: Defines player behavior, such as human or AI players.
- `Move`: Represents a move on the chessboard to be saved in the log.
- `Engine`: Implements the game engine to manage turns and moves.

The front end uses SFML to create a graphical user interface for the chess game.
